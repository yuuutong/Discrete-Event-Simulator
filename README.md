# Discrete-Event-Simulator
Used object-oriented programming and various data structures, to simulate changes in the state of a system across time, with each transition from one state of the system to another triggered via an event. 

Laid the foundation for improving operational efficiency in real-world systems, such as the queueing system to check out in supermarkets, or to order food at restaurants.
